# Dark-Mode-Calculator

Here's a Calculator i made using python and tkinter. I made one complete function instead of multiple functions for the different 
calculator buttons, the main reason beeing that I thought it would be easier for a designer to design around it, since they don't
need to rememeber the different functions names (Even though it probably would only be 3 functions total...). I've also not included 
a square root function since having another button in the GUI won't look that great for the way I've designed it. When I made the 
GUI I used the tkinter module. I've seen a trend in using dark mode GUI's on different websites and software, so I wanted to design a
Dark Mode Calculator. Feel free to use my Calculator function to design your own calculator. 
I want you to know that this project is not complete. I've had a few people user-test it, and they didn't find any bugs. If you find
any bugs, please let me know. 

Important things I've learned when making this Calculator:
I found something very usefull that I will find very usefull in future projects, which is that I can use the eval method in python 
to evaluate a arithmetic problem from a string. For instance eval("1+2") will calculate the arithmetic problem inside the string and
output a int value of 3. I don't know why I didn't know about this, but I'm glad I know about it now!

Note that this is just a hobby project I did in my spare time.
